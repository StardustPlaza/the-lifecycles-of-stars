			<h2>Here's some differences between low and high mass stars:</h2>
			 <ul style="font-family:TimesNewRoman;">
			  <li>luminosity</li>
			  <li>size (surprise surprise)</li>
			  <li>colour</li>
			  <li>temperature</li>
			</ul><br>
			<p>Massive stars are more luminous because they require more energy to keep itself from collapsing. This extra amount of energy being released from nuclear fusion means that stars with more mass are brighter. Here's an equation from Wikipedia:</p>
			<img src="../info/equation.png" style="width: 20%;">
			<p>L⊙ and M⊙ are the luminosity and mass of the Sun, and a is greater than one and less than 6.</p><br>
			<p>The size of massive against low-mass stars seems obvious: more mass using the same material means more volume. It is important to note that massive stars are rare because star formation is very inefficient.</p><br>
			<p>The colour of a star depends on its temperature. Red typically means under 4000K, yellow is around 5500K and blue are the hottest being at least 10,000 up to 50,000K. Massive stars have higher gravity, and thus more pressure. This causes nuclear fusion to occur at a faster rate, increasing the temperature of the core, which is why massive stars are blue.</p><br>
			<p>Temperature is also relatively obvious: massive stars require higher pressure than low mass stars to keep together against the force of gravity. Therefore, lots of energy is released in the form of heat. This heat is released by nuclear fusion, via the proton-proton chain, where one fuel fuses with itself to create a heavier element.</p><br>
